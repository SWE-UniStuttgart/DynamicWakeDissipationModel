# DynamicWakeDissipationModel
The wake dissipation model is an engineering model that described several effects of a turbine wake. Mainly the wake deficit, the wake evolution and the wake redirection is included. Its primal purpose is to serve as internal model in a model-based wake tracking approach for closed-loop wake redirection as introduced in [1]. The computational costs are very low since engineering modelling techniques are used.
